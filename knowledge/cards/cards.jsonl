{"questionId": "deductible_basics", "question": "What is a deductible and how does it work?", "themeId": "costs_deductibles", "answer": "A deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket for covered healthcare services before your insurance starts paying. For example, if you have a $1,500 deductible, you'll pay the first $1,500 of covered medical expenses yourself. After meeting your deductible, your insurance typically pays a larger share through coinsurance or copays. Deductibles reset annually, usually on January 1st or your plan anniversary date. Some services like preventive care are often covered before you meet your deductible. Family plans may have both individual and family deductibles - once any family member meets the individual deductible, insurance starts paying for that person. The family deductible covers everyone once the total family spending reaches that amount.", "checklist": ["Check your plan documents for your specific deductible amount", "Ask if preventive services are covered before meeting deductible", "Track your medical expenses throughout the year", "Understand whether you have separate deductibles for medical and pharmacy", "Know when your deductible resets (plan year vs calendar year)", "Verify if your plan has separate in-network and out-of-network deductibles"], "phoneScript": "Hi, I'm calling to confirm my deductible amount and understand how it works.

{"questionId": "eob_reading", "question": "What is an EOB and how do I read it?", "themeId": "claims_eobs", "answer": "An Explanation of Benefits (EOB) is a statement from your insurance company explaining how they processed a claim for medical services you received. It's not a bill - it shows what your provider charged, what your insurance allowed, what they paid, and what you may owe. Key sections include: Provider information and service dates; Billed charges (what the provider originally charged); Allowed amount (what your insurance considers reasonable); Plan paid (what insurance actually paid); Your responsibility (what you owe, including deductible, copay, or coinsurance). The EOB also shows claim status codes and any denials or adjustments. Compare your EOB to bills from providers to ensure accuracy.

{"questionId": "surprise_billing_protection", "question": "What is surprise billing and am I protected?", "themeId": "surprise_billing", "answer": "Surprise billing occurs when you receive care from an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility, or during an emergency, resulting in unexpected high bills. The federal No Surprises Act, effective January 2022, protects you in specific situations: emergency services at any facility; non-emergency services at in-network facilities from out-of-network providers (unless you consent); air ambulance services. You're protected when you have no choice in selecting your provider. The law limits your cost-sharing to in-network amounts. If you receive a surprise bill, you're only responsible for your normal in-network copay, deductible, or coinsurance. Providers and insurance companies must resolve payment disputes through an independent process, not by billing you extra. However, ground ambulances aren't federally protected yet, though some states have their own protections.", "checklist": ["Verify if your situation qualifies for No Surprises Act protection", "Check if you signed any consent forms for out-of-network care", "Contact your insurance company immediately if you receive a surprise bill", "Keep records of all communications about the disputed charges", "Don't pay disputed amounts while the matter is being resolved", "File a complaint with federal agencies if protections aren't honored"], "phoneScript": "I believe I received a surprise bill that should be protected under the No Surprises Act.

{"questionId": "preventive_care_coverage", "question": "What preventive services are covered at 100%?", "themeId": "preventive_care", "answer": "Under the Affordable Care Act, most health plans must cover certain preventive services at 100% with no cost-sharing when you use in-network providers. Covered services include: annual wellness visits and physical exams; cancer screenings (mammograms, colonoscopies, cervical cancer screening); immunizations and vaccinations; blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screenings; contraceptive services and counseling; mental health screening and depression screening; tobacco cessation counseling. The specific services depend on your age, gender, and risk factors, following guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, CDC, and other health organizations.

{"questionId": "appeal_insurance_denial", "question": "How do I appeal an insurance denial?", "themeId": "appeals_process", "answer": "You have the right to appeal any insurance denial through a formal process. Most plans require appeals within 180 days of the denial notice. Start with an internal appeal directly to your insurance company - this is usually free and required before external options. Gather all relevant documentation: denial letter, medical records, provider notes, and any supporting research or guidelines. Write a clear appeal letter explaining why the service should be covered, referencing your plan documents and medical necessity. Submit everything by certified mail or through your insurance company's online portal. If your internal appeal is denied, you can request an external review by an independent organization - this is also typically free. For urgent situations, you can request an expedited appeal that must be decided within 72 hours.
