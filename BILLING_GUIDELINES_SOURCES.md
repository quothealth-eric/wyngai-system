3. **No Personal Data Mining**: We do not collect or analyze individual billing data from external sources
4. **Static Knowledge Base**: Information is curated from authoritative, publicly available sources

### Knowledge Application Process

1. **Pattern Recognition**: User input is analyzed for keywords related to known billing scenarios
2. **Regulation Matching**: Relevant federal and state regulations are identified
3. **Context-Aware Guidance**: Specific guidance is provided based on detected billing patterns
4. **Citation Generation**: Proper legal and regulatory citations are included in responses

### Quality Assurance
